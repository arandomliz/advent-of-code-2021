# Evaluation of my input data

Due to hard memory limitations on the embedded device, I'll need to trick a bit in
order to solve the task. This probably results into a solution that works mostly only
on my chip, but I don't care tbh.

In the generated images, one can see all fields that A* visited in task a using my 
input cave file. I hope with this to reduce the amounts of squares visited / needed
to be in memory.
