/** # Idea
 * Using any kind of __store stuff in memory__ would
 * kill my RAM. Even task 1 would need a highly 
 * efficient bitvector storage, that would consume 
 * about 125kb RAM (or Â¼ of it). Looking at my input
 * this is very very far from enough for task b.
 * 
 * Soooo? What's the solution?
 * 
 * Well instead of storing each and every cuboid that
 * will be turned on or off, I'll store a cube with 
 * maybe thousands or more cuboids in it which will 
 * help me will represent that.
 *
 * ## Generating the cubes
 * Here comes the tricky part. Let's say we've two cubes 
 * that describe the on/off state. The first represents on,
 * the second has the commando to turn them off.
 *
 * Soo? Intersecting them and splitting the result into
 * cubes would bring me in a fairly essy way 26 new cubes
 * (looking at rubics cube here).
 *
 * Which isn't really ideal either as you can do it with
 * 6 cubes at most. Although now is the question wether that
 * would need special cases in order to do that.
 *
 * So I'll start with the 26 new cubes (at most if Y is 
 * completely contained by X) and go on from there if I
 * hit a memory limit.
